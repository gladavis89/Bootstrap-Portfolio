          <p>My name is GarrettLee Alexander Davis. My first name means kind hearted warrior(with a spear), and my middle name 
            means leader of man. I've always strived to live up to the name my parents gave me (after all, I got it for my birthday).
          </p>

          <p>Growing up, I was very engrossed with computers and technology in general. I marveled at how people could create worlds
            with electricity and electronic components. My first job, in fact, was repairing electronics for my school district. 
            I've always wanted to learn the software side of devices but I didn't think I was smart enough.
          </p>

          <p>The Trilogy bootcamp has not only proven to me I can code, they have shown me I can code well. Within the short time of this schooling, 
            they will have trained me to be a master web developer both back-end and front-end.
